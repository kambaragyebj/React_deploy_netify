I faced a similar problem, on my virtual machine everything worked Ubuntu, but on Windows
there was a problem

I added to RUN npm install --force --loglevel verbose, logging level and saw that I had a problem with the certificate
=> => # npm http fetch GET https://registry.npmjs.org/npm attempt 1 failed with SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN
Before NPM install I added RUN npm config set strict-ssl false
And it worked
